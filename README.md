    - I used butterknife more info here: [butterknife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife)
    - Butterknife is already implemented in the gradle so you can use **@Bind**
    - Are we going to create a server for the  *Username* and *Password* or make hardcode them?
        - *admin/admin* is hardcoded
    - Any ideas for the logo? and Colors?

    - Also, do you guys know if there is a way for us to use one login screen and direct to different screens               (off/civ) depending on the usernames? Just wondering if we really need two different login screens
