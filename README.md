Â© Incident-Report
CSC 4998 Mobile Project

The Incident-Report Application was created as a mock ememergency operator system that works like a traditional 911 operator. The mobile platform offers many options for capturing emergency situations, and responding to them immediately. 

The Three Structures:
<ul>
  <li>User APP - Report an Incident, Take a picture, Detail the incident</li>
  <li>Responders APP - Recieve Incident report, View image gallery, Read incident type and respond via push notification</li>
  <li>Dispatch APP - Recieve report from User APP, and assign accordingly to the correct officer.</li>
  </ul>
  
With everyones familiarity with smart devices, and comfort with taking pictures and typing emergency details, this app would be ideal for the users that would be interacting with the application.
